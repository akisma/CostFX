## Issue 47 â€“ Backend Phase 2 Progress (CSV Transformation)
- Implemented `CsvInventoryTransformer` with shared helper reuse, unit tests, and validation coverage for inventory csv headers and data coercion.
- Implemented `CsvSalesTransformer` with fuzzy location/item matching, unit tests, and safeguards for missing metadata.
- Added `CsvTransformService` orchestrating inventory/sales transforms with error thresholds, persistence to `CsvTransform`, and structured result summaries.
- Wired up `transformInventoryUpload` and `transformSalesUpload` controller endpoints plus routing under `/api/v1/data/csv`, including dry-run handling and request validation.
- Extended Vitest coverage: `CsvTransformService.test.js`, `CsvSalesTransformer.test.js`, and updated `CsvUploadService.test.js` leveraging non-mutating model overrides.
- Verified backend suite via `npm test`; all suites pass with CSV upload + transform workflows operational.
