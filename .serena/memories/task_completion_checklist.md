# Task Completion Checklist
- Ensure plan approved before coding; document decisions and updates in docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md and docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md when phases finish.
- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run test` (all packages) and confirm success; rerun any failed command immediately.
- Verify `npm run dev` (or individual dev servers) start without errors.
- Update GitHub issue with progress comments and maintain knowledge graph memories.
- Avoid git commits/pushes/reverts unless supervisor directs; never leave TODOs or skipped tests.
- Add/refresh Swagger docs for API changes and keep documentation synchronized.
