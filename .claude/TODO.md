## 🎯 Current Mission: AWS ECS Deployment Architecture

### **Phase 7: AWS ECS Container Deployment** ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create separate production Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
- [x] Design complete Terraform infrastructure for AWS ECS
- [x] Implement VPC, security groups, and networking
- [x] Set up RDS PostgreSQL and ElastiCache Redis managed services
- [x] Configure Application Load Balancer with path-based routing
- [x] Create ECR repositories and ECS cluster configuration
- [x] Implement SSM Parameter Store for secrets management
- [x] Build deployment scripts and local testing tools
- [x] Ensure GitHub Actions compatibility with configurable ports
- [x] Create comprehensive deployment documentation

### **Current Status: Ready for Production Deployment** ✅
- **Container Architecture**: Frontend (Nginx) and Backend (Node.js) in separate containers
- **Infrastructure**: Complete AWS ECS infrastructure with Terraform
- **Security**: Private subnets, security groups, managed secrets
- **Deployment**: One-command deployment script (`./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh`)
- **Testing**: Local container testing with `./deploy/scripts/test-local.sh`
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions compatible with environment variables
- **Port Management**: Flexible and configurable for development and production

### **AWS Infrastructure Components** ✅
- **ECS Cluster**: Fargate tasks for frontend and backend
- **Load Balancer**: ALB with `/api/*` → backend, `/*` → frontend routing
- **Databases**: RDS PostgreSQL and ElastiCache Redis (managed)
- **Container Registry**: ECR repositories for both services
- **Networking**: VPC with public/private subnets and NAT gateways
- **Security**: Security groups and IAM roles with least privilege
- **Secrets**: SSM Parameter Store for database URLs, JWT secrets, API keys
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and health checks

### **Deployment Features** ✅
- **Environment Flexibility**: dev/staging/prod configurations
- **Secret Management**: Secure parameter store integration
- **Auto-scaling Ready**: Configurable task counts and resources
- **Cost Optimized**: t3.micro instances for development
- **Health Monitoring**: Application and infrastructure health checks
- **Build-time Configuration**: API URLs configured during Docker build
