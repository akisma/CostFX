# TODO (as of 2025-09-10)

High-priority
- Backend connectivity: ensure SSL no-verify path works end-to-end
  - Confirm ECS service uses the latest image (consider pinning digest or bumping task definition)
  - Add PGSSLMODE=no-verify as an environment variable in the task definition
  - If still failing, consider adding RDS CA bundle trust (download CA, mount, set sslrootcert)
- HTTPS enablement: obtain a valid ACM cert in us-west-2; set SSM /costfx/dev/ssl_certificate_arn; apply Terraform
- CI/CD: implement GitHub Actions for build/push and ECS deploy (frontend, backend)

Medium
- CloudWatch logs: increase retention to 30d; add structured log fields; add error alarms
- Health checks: add /health in backend and align ECS/ALB health checks
- DB migrations: wire a safe migration step or job

Low
- Docs: add runbooks for common failures (CannotPullContainerError, SSL issues)
- Security: consider task definitions with secrets via AWS Secrets Manager instead of SSM
