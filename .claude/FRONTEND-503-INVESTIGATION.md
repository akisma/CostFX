# Frontend Service 503 Error Investigation

**Date:** September 13, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH - Frontend not serving properly  
**Status:** IDENTIFIED ISSUE - Needs Investigation

## üö® **Problem Summary**

The frontend ECS service is returning **503 Service Unavailable** errors, while the backend API is working perfectly at https://cost-fx.com/api/v1/.

## üîç **What We Know**

### **Working Components:**
- ‚úÖ Backend API: https://cost-fx.com/api/v1/ (Restaurant AI System responding)
- ‚úÖ Load Balancer: Properly routing API traffic to backend
- ‚úÖ SSL/DNS: Certificate and domain resolution working
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure: All monitoring, security, cost controls operational

### **Failing Component:**
- ‚ùå Frontend Service: https://cost-fx.com/ returns 503 errors
- ‚ùå Frontend container appears to have startup/health check issues

## üéØ **Investigation Areas**

### **1. ECS Service Health**
- Check ECS service status and task health
- Review container startup logs
- Verify health check endpoints and configuration
- Check if frontend containers are actually running

### **2. Load Balancer Routing**
- Verify ALB target group health for frontend
- Check listener rules routing to frontend service
- Examine health check configuration (path, timeouts, thresholds)

### **3. Container Configuration**
- Review frontend Dockerfile for proper web server setup
- Check if frontend app is binding to correct host/port
- Verify environment variables and configuration
- Ensure container is serving on expected port (likely 80 or 3000)

### **4. Application Code Issues**
- Frontend build process may be failing
- Missing static assets or build artifacts
- Node.js/React app may not be starting properly
- Check if frontend app expects specific environment setup

## üìù **Diagnostic Commands to Run**

```bash
# Check ECS service status
aws ecs describe-services --cluster costfx-dev --services costfx-dev-frontend

# Check running tasks
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster costfx-dev --service-name costfx-dev-frontend

# Get task details and logs
aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster costfx-dev --tasks [TASK-ARN]

# Check ALB target group health
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn [FRONTEND-TG-ARN]

# Review container logs
aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name /ecs/costfx-dev-frontend --log-stream-name [STREAM-NAME]
```

## üîß **Likely Root Causes**

1. **Health Check Misconfiguration**: Frontend app may not be responding on expected health check path
2. **Port Binding Issues**: Container may not be listening on the port ALB expects
3. **Build/Startup Failures**: Frontend build process or app startup failing silently
4. **Environment Configuration**: Missing environment variables or incorrect configuration

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Immediate Diagnosis**: Check ECS task logs and health status
2. **Health Check Review**: Verify ALB health check configuration matches frontend app
3. **Container Debugging**: Potentially exec into running container or check startup logs
4. **Frontend Code Review**: Ensure frontend app is properly containerized and configured

## üí° **Architecture Context**

The backend is working perfectly, which means:
- Infrastructure (VPC, security groups, ALB) is properly configured
- The issue is specific to the frontend application or its container configuration
- This is likely a containerization or application-level issue, not infrastructure
