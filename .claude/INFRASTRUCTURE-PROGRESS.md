## üîÑ Step 7: RDS Enhancements - PENDING  
**Status: PAUSED - Will implement based on app requirements**
- **Rationale:** Database optimizations should align with actual application data patterns, query performance needs, and backup requirements
- **Planned Resources:**
  - RDS read replica configuration
  - Enhanced monitoring and performance insights
  - Automated backup optimization
  - Connection pooling configuration
  - Database parameter tuning
