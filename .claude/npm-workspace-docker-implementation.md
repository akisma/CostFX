# NPM Workspace Docker Implementation - Project Memo

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Project:** CostFX  
**Branch:** feature/aws-deploy-v1  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Option 1 Successfully Implemented

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented **Option 1: Root-Level Package-Lock with Workspace Targeting** for npm workspaces in Docker containers. Both backend and frontend now build and run correctly in production-ready containerized environments with proper dependency management.

## Problem Statement

The project needed to containerize a npm workspace monorepo structure with:
- Root-level `package.json` defining workspaces
- `backend/` workspace (Node.js API)
- `frontend/` workspace (React + Vite)
- `shared/` workspace (common utilities)

Initial attempts failed because Docker builds weren't workspace-aware and dependencies weren't resolving correctly.

## Solution Architecture: Option 1

### Core Approach
- Use root-level `package-lock.json` for consistent dependency resolution
- Target specific workspaces with `npm ci --workspace=<name>` commands
- Maintain workspace hierarchy while optimizing Docker layer caching

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Dockerfile (`deploy/docker/Dockerfile.backend`)
```dockerfile
# Key workspace-aware installation
RUN npm ci --workspace=backend --omit=dev && npm cache clean --force

# Copy workspace structure
COPY package*.json ./
COPY backend/package*.json ./backend/

# Copy backend source after dependency installation
COPY backend/ ./backend/
```

#### Frontend Dockerfile (`deploy/docker/Dockerfile.frontend`)
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build with workspace targeting
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Install ALL dependencies (including dev) for build stage
RUN npm ci --workspace=frontend && npm cache clean --force

# Build process
WORKDIR /app/frontend
RUN npm run build

# Production stage with nginx
FROM nginx:alpine AS production
COPY --from=builder /app/frontend/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
```

#### Docker Compose Configuration
```yaml
frontend:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: deploy/docker/Dockerfile.frontend
    target: production  # Explicitly target production stage
    args:
      VITE_API_URL: http://localhost:${BACKEND_EXTERNAL_PORT}/api/v1
```

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend Build Dependencies
**Problem:** `npm ci --workspace=frontend --omit=dev` excluded Vite (dev dependency) needed for building  
**Solution:** Use `npm ci --workspace=frontend` in builder stage to include dev dependencies

### 2. Docker Multi-Stage Target
**Problem:** Docker wasn't building the production stage with nginx  
**Solution:** Added `target: production` in docker-compose to explicitly target production stage

### 3. Nginx User Conflicts
**Problem:** Dockerfile tried to create nginx user that already existed  
**Solution:** Added conditional user creation:
```dockerfile
RUN if ! getent group nginx >/dev/null 2>&1; then addgroup -g 1001 -S nginx; fi && \
    if ! getent passwd nginx >/dev/null 2>&1; then adduser -S nginx -u 1001 -G nginx; fi
```

### 4. Health Check Logic
**Problem:** Script had infinite loop waiting for health checks  
**Solution:** Improved health check logic with:
- Proper timeout handling (3 minutes)
- Individual service health tracking
- Container failure detection
- Meaningful status reporting

```

## Testing & Validation

### Test Script Features (`deploy/scripts/test-local.sh`)
- **Port Configuration:** Non-conflicting ports (backend: 3002, frontend: 8081)
- **Health Monitoring:** Individual service health tracking
- **Error Handling:** Container failure detection and logging
- **Cleanup:** Automatic cleanup on exit with trap
- **Environment Support:** GitHub Actions compatibility

### Validation Results
```bash
✅ Backend API: http://localhost:3002/api/v1/
✅ Frontend: http://localhost:8081/ (nginx serving production build)
✅ Database: PostgreSQL healthy on port 5433
✅ Cache: Redis healthy on port 6380
✅ Health Checks: All services reporting healthy
```

## Alternative Options Considered

### Option 2: Individual Package-Locks
- Each workspace maintains its own `package-lock.json`
- More isolated but harder to maintain consistency
- **Status:** Not implemented (Option 1 was sufficient)

### Option 3: Build Context Copying
- Copy entire workspace context to each container
- Simpler but less efficient (larger build contexts)
- **Status:** Not implemented (Option 1 was more efficient)

## Best Practices Established

### Docker Layer Optimization
1. Copy package files first for dependency caching
2. Install dependencies before copying source code
3. Use multi-stage builds for production optimization
4. Clean npm cache after installation

### Workspace Dependency Management
1. Use `--workspace=<name>` for targeted installation
2. Include dev dependencies in build stages when needed
3. Exclude dev dependencies in runtime stages
4. Maintain workspace hierarchy in Docker context

### Testing & Debugging
1. Implement comprehensive health checks
2. Use meaningful error messages and logging
3. Provide container status and logs on failures
4. Support both local development and CI environments

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"nginx user already exists"**
   - Add conditional user creation checks
   - Use `getent` to check existing users/groups

2. **"vite command not found"**
   - Ensure dev dependencies included in build stage
   - Don't use `--omit=dev` when build tools are needed

3. **Frontend serves dev instead of production**
   - Verify `target: production` in docker-compose
   - Check multi-stage build execution

4. **Health checks failing**
   - Verify endpoint URLs match actual service paths
   - Check internal vs external port configurations
   - Ensure services are actually ready before health checks

## Future Considerations

### Production Deployment
- This setup is ready for production deployment
- Consider implementing Docker secrets for sensitive data
- Add monitoring and logging for production environments

### Scaling
- Current setup supports horizontal scaling
- Consider implementing service discovery for multi-instance deployments
- Add load balancing configuration for frontend

### Security
- Implement proper secret management
- Add security scanning to Docker build pipeline
- Consider using distroless images for smaller attack surface

## Commands for Quick Reference

```bash
# Test the complete setup
./deploy/scripts/test-local.sh

# Build individual containers
docker build -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile.backend -t costfx-backend .
docker build -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile.frontend --target production -t costfx-frontend .

# Debug container issues
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs <service-name>
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml ps

# Clean up
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Backend builds and runs successfully
- ✅ Frontend builds production bundle and serves via nginx
- ✅ All dependencies resolve correctly through workspace targeting
- ✅ Docker layer caching optimized for development workflow
- ✅ Health checks pass consistently
- ✅ Test script provides comprehensive validation
- ✅ Setup ready for production deployment

**Next Steps:** This implementation is complete and ready for production deployment. The architecture supports scaling and can be enhanced with additional monitoring, security, and deployment automation as needed.
