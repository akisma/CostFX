# Mobile Testing - iOS & Android Device Testing

## ✅ What I Streamlined

1. **Removed bare workflow native code** (`android/`, `ios/` directories)
2. **Simplified package.json** - removed cross-env workarounds
3. **Removed unused dependencies** - cut from 14 to 4 core deps
4. **Updated .gitignore** - ignore native build artifacts
5. **Added device testing guide** - README with clear steps

## 🚀 How to Test on Devices (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Expo Go
- **iOS**: App Store → "Expo Go"  
- **Android**: Play Store → "Expo Go"

### Step 2: Run & Scan
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

That's it! App runs on your phone.

## 📱 Testing Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
cd mobile && npm start

# 2. QR code appears in terminal
# 3. Open Expo Go app on your phone
# 4. Scan QR code
# 5. App loads on device instantly
# 6. Edit mobile/App.js → auto-reloads on phone
```

## Why Expo Go?

- ✅ No native builds needed
- ✅ Works on any iOS/Android device
- ✅ Instant reload on device
- ✅ Single command to test
- ✅ No Xcode/Android Studio setup
- ❌ Some native modules not supported

## When to Upgrade to EAS Build?

Use EAS Build only when you need:
- Push notifications
- Native modules not in Expo SDK
- Custom native code
- App Store deployment

For now, Expo Go is perfect for rapid testing! 🎯
