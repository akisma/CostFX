- [ ] Add `alert_email` variable to `variables.tf`
- [ ] Include email validation
- [ ] Test: `terraform validate`
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: add alert_email variable for monitoring setup"

#### **STEP 2: Basic CloudWatch Monitoring Setup**
*Priority: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Risk: LOW*
- [ ] Create `monitoring-basic.tf` file
- [ ] Add CloudWatch alarms for:
  - [ ] ALB response time (>1s threshold)
  - [ ] ECS CPU utilization (>80% threshold)  
  - [ ] RDS CPU utilization (>80% threshold)
- [ ] Create SNS topic for alerts
- [ ] Add email subscription (if alert_email provided)
- [ ] Test: `terraform plan` and verify no conflicts
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: add basic CloudWatch monitoring and alerts"

#### **STEP 3: Enhanced S3 Security for ALB Logs**
*Priority: HIGH | Effort: LOW | Risk: LOW*
- [ ] Create `s3-security.tf` file
- [ ] Add to existing ALB logs bucket:
  - [ ] Server-side encryption (AES256)
  - [ ] Versioning enabled
  - [ ] Public access blocking
  - [ ] Lifecycle policies (30d IA, 90d Glacier, 365d delete)
- [ ] Test: `terraform plan` for S3 changes only
- [ ] Test: Verify ALB logs still working
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: enhance S3 security for ALB logs"

#### **STEP 4: WAF Protection for Load Balancer**
*Priority: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Risk: MEDIUM*
- [ ] Create `waf.tf` file
- [ ] Add AWS WAF Web ACL with:
  - [ ] AWS Managed Core Rule Set
  - [ ] Rate limiting rule (2000 requests/5min per IP)
  - [ ] CloudWatch metrics enabled
- [ ] Associate WAF with existing ALB
- [ ] Test: Verify ALB still responds normally
- [ ] Test: Verify WAF metrics in CloudWatch
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: add WAF protection to load balancer"

#### **STEP 5: Cost Monitoring Setup**
*Priority: MEDIUM | Effort: LOW | Risk: LOW*
- [ ] Create `cost-monitoring.tf` file
- [ ] Add cost anomaly detection for EC2/RDS
- [ ] Add budget alert ($50/month for dev environment)
- [ ] Add cost anomaly subscription (email alerts)
- [ ] Test: Verify budget creation in AWS console
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: add cost monitoring and budget alerts"

#### **STEP 6: ECS Auto Scaling**
*Priority: MEDIUM | Effort: MEDIUM | Risk: MEDIUM*
- [ ] Create `ecs-autoscaling.tf` file
- [ ] Add auto-scaling target for backend service
- [ ] Add scaling policies:
  - [ ] CPU-based scaling (target 70%)
  - [ ] Memory-based scaling (target 80%)
- [ ] Configure scaling limits (dev: 1-3, prod: 2-10)
- [ ] Test: Monitor ECS service scaling behavior
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: add auto-scaling to ECS services"

#### **STEP 7: Enhanced RDS Configuration**
*Priority: MEDIUM | Effort: HIGH | Risk: HIGH*
- [ ] Create `rds-enhanced.tf` file
- [ ] Add RDS parameter group for query logging
- [ ] Add enhanced monitoring (60s intervals)
- [ ] Add CloudWatch log exports for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Configure backup retention (7d dev, 30d prod)
- [ ] Test: Verify database connectivity after changes
- [ ] Test: Check enhanced monitoring in CloudWatch
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: enhance RDS monitoring and configuration"

### üîß FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Lower Priority)

#### **STEP 8: Redis ElastiCache (Optional)**
*Priority: LOW | Effort: HIGH | Risk: MEDIUM*
- [ ] Create `redis.tf` file
- [ ] Add ElastiCache replication group
- [ ] Configure encryption at rest/transit
- [ ] Update backend to use Redis for caching
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: add Redis ElastiCache for caching"

#### **STEP 9: X-Ray Distributed Tracing (Optional)**
*Priority: LOW | Effort: HIGH | Risk: LOW*
- [ ] Create `xray.tf` file
- [ ] Add X-Ray sampling rules
- [ ] Update ECS task definitions with X-Ray sidecar
- [ ] Add X-Ray IAM permissions
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "feat: add X-Ray distributed tracing"

### üö® KNOWN ISSUES TO ADDRESS

#### **Frontend Service Investigation**
*Priority: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Risk: LOW*
- [ ] Check frontend ECS service logs
- [ ] Verify frontend Docker image builds correctly
- [ ] Check frontend health check configuration
- [ ] Investigate task startup failures
- [ ] **COMMIT**: "fix: resolve frontend service startup issues"

### üìä TESTING CHECKLIST (After Each Step)

#### Pre-Deployment Tests
- [ ] `terraform validate` passes
- [ ] `terraform plan` shows expected changes only
- [ ] No resource conflicts or duplicates

#### Post-Deployment Tests  
- [ ] `terraform apply` completes successfully
- [ ] Backend API responds: `curl https://cost-fx.com/api/v1/`
- [ ] Frontend loads: `curl https://cost-fx.com/`
- [ ] No new errors in CloudWatch logs

#### Production Readiness Tests
- [ ] SSL certificate valid and trusted
- [ ] WAF blocking malicious requests (if implemented)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts working (send test alert)
- [ ] Auto-scaling triggers properly (if implemented)

### üìù COMMIT MESSAGE TEMPLATES

```
feat: add alert_email variable for monitoring setup
feat: add basic CloudWatch monitoring and alerts  
feat: enhance S3 security for ALB logs
feat: add WAF protection to load balancer
feat: add cost monitoring and budget alerts
feat: add auto-scaling to ECS services
feat: enhance RDS monitoring and configuration
fix: resolve frontend service startup issues
```

### üéØ CURRENT STATUS
- **Next Step**: Step 1 - Add Alert Email Variable
- **Branch**: feature/aws-deploy-v1
- **Environment**: dev
- **Last Successful Test**: Backend API responding at https://cost-fx.com/api/v1/

### üìã DECISION LOG
- Decided to implement WAF before auto-scaling (security first)
- Using managed AWS rules for WAF (simpler maintenance)
- Keeping dev environment costs low with smaller instance sizes
- Focusing on monitoring before performance optimization
