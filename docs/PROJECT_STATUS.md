**NEXT THING TO TACKLE!!!!**
We need to downgrade our AWS services, it's costing a fortune. we are ONLY in development and do not need production quality infrastructure. Focus should be easy deploys.
From AWS:
Option 2: Replace with NAT Instance (Development Only)
Savings: ~$25-30/month

Use a small EC2 instance (t3.nano ~$3.80/month) as a NAT instance instead
Good for development environments with low traffic
Not recommended for production
Option 3: Remove Private Subnets (If Possible)
Savings: ~$35-50/month

If your applications don't need to be in private subnets, move them to public subnets
Use security groups for access control instead
