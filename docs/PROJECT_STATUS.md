   - **Cause**: Square SDK's `revokeToken()` method not properly configured with Basic Auth
   - **Impact**: Disconnect API call failed, tokens not revoked with Square
   - **Fix**: Replaced SDK call with direct axios HTTP POST using Basic Auth (base64 encoded clientId:clientSecret)
   - **Details**: Square's revoke endpoint requires `Authorization: Basic <credentials>` header
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested

3. ⚠️ **Frontend Bug: Location Name Not Displaying** - Empty bullet point in Synced Locations list
   - **Location**: `frontend/src/components/pos/square/ConnectionStatus.jsx` line 206
   - **Cause**: Component referenced `location.name` but backend sends `location.locationName`
   - **Impact**: Location names invisible in UI, poor user experience
   - **Fix**: Updated to use `location.locationName` with fallback to `location.name`
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested

**Production Debugging & Fixes:**
- ✅ **OAuth State Token**: Fixed single-use token consumption issue
  - Backend now completes all processing before redirecting
  - Frontend receives simple `?success=true` instead of re-processing OAuth
- ✅ **Data Contract**: Fixed Redux field name mismatches
  - `locations` (not `selectedLocations`)
  - `connected` (not `isConnected`)
  - `connection.status` (not top-level `status`)
- ✅ **Component Props**: Fixed missing `className` prop in LocationSelector
- ✅ **Local State**: Added `callbackProcessedLocal` to prevent double-processing
- ✅ **Disconnect Bug**: Removed undefined `setIsDisconnecting` call, uses Redux state

#### **✅ Issue #18: Square-Focused Database Schema** (COMPLETE)

**Implementation Status**: 100% Complete - Database + ORM Layer Operational

**Core Deliverables:**
- ✅ **Comprehensive Schema Design**: `docs/SQUARE_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` (2,700+ lines)
  - Two-tier architecture: POS-specific raw data (Tier 1) → Unified analytics (Tier 2)
  - 5 Square tables + inventory_items enhancement
  - Complete field definitions with exact column specifications
  - Example data, transformation patterns, and index justifications
- ✅ **Database Migrations**: 6 production-ready migrations
  - `1759800000000_add-pos-source-tracking-to-inventory-items.js` - Enhance Tier 2 table
  - `1759800000001_create-square-categories.js` - Square Catalog categories
  - `1759800000002_create-square-menu-items.js` - Square Catalog items with PostgreSQL arrays
  - `1759800000003_create-square-inventory-counts.js` - Inventory snapshots over time
  - `1759800000004_create-square-orders.js` - Complete order data with state enum
  - `1759800000005_create-square-order-items.js` - Denormalized line items for performance
- ✅ **Sequelize Models**: 5 fully-implemented ORM models
  - `SquareCategory.js` - JSONB validation, helper methods (getCategoryName, isDeleted)
  - `SquareMenuItem.js` - Custom getter/setter for PostgreSQL arrays, pricing helpers
  - `SquareInventoryCount.js` - Immutable snapshots, state validation
  - `SquareOrder.js` - State enum validation, dollar conversion helpers
  - `SquareOrderItem.js` - Immutable records, quantity/pricing validation
- ✅ **Model Associations**: Complete foreign key relationships
  - belongsTo: POSConnection, Restaurant, SquareLocation (where applicable)
  - hasMany: SquareInventoryCount, SquareOrderItem (from parent models)
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Vitest mocks for all new models
  - Updated `tests/setup.js` with sharedDataStores and vi.mock() calls
  - 399/399 tests passing (no regressions)
- ✅ **Technical Documentation**: Permanent solutions documented
  - Added "⚠️ CRITICAL: New Sequelize Models Must Be Registered in Test Mocks" to TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md
  - Updated migrations/README-SQUARE-SCHEMA.md with ES modules warning
  - Added detailed examples and troubleshooting for future developers

**Database Tables Created:**
```
square_categories       - 5 indexes, JSONB storage, partial index on is_deleted
square_menu_items       - 8 indexes, GIN index on square_data JSONB, text[] for category_ids
square_inventory_counts - 8 indexes, composite idx_square_inventory_latest for queries
square_orders           - 9 indexes, partial idx_square_orders_sales_report for analytics
square_order_items      - 6 indexes, composite idx_square_order_items_sales for reporting
inventory_items         - Enhanced with source_pos_provider, source_pos_item_id, source_pos_data
```

**Key Design Patterns:**
- **JSONB Storage**: All Square API responses preserved in `square_data` column for audit trail
- **Denormalized Fields**: Common query fields extracted for performance (name, price, quantity, etc.)
- **PostgreSQL Arrays**: `text[]` type for category_ids with custom Sequelize getter/setter
- **Monetary Values**: All amounts stored in cents (Square's smallest currency unit)
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Square `version` field tracked for sync conflict detection
- **Immutable Records**: Inventory counts and order items have no updatedAt (historical snapshots)

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
1. **ES Modules Issue (RECURRING)**: Migration files must use `export const up/down`, not `exports.up`
   - Documented in 3 locations to prevent future recurrence
2. **DataTypes.ARRAY Compatibility**: `DataTypes.ARRAY(DataTypes.TEXT)` not working
   - Solution: Use `DataTypes.TEXT` with custom getter/setter for PostgreSQL array format
3. **Test Mock Registration**: "belongsTo is not a function" error
   - Root cause: New models not registered in `tests/setup.js`
   - Solution: Add to `sharedDataStores` Map AND `vi.mock()` calls
   - **This was the hidden blocker** - models loaded fine directly but failed in test environment

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### **Development Workflow**
- **Research → Plan → Implement**: Always follow this sequence
- **Hook Compliance**: ZERO tolerance for lint/test/build failures
- **Parallel Development**: Leverage multiple development tracks
- **Feature Flags**: New features deployed behind SSM-controlled flags
- **Small Increments**: Reviewable, testable changes

### **Quality Gates**
- All hooks must pass: `npm run lint && npm run build && npm test`
- Test coverage maintained at 100% for new features
- Docker builds must succeed for both containers
- Infrastructure changes validated with `terraform plan`
- Manual testing completed before merge

### **Current Technical Debt: Minimal**
- ES Modules configuration optimized for Jest compatibility
- Docker multi-stage builds implemented for efficiency
- Database connection pooling configured for production scale
- Error handling centralized with structured logging
- Security headers and middleware properly configured
